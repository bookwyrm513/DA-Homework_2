# DA-Homework_2
This repository contains the vba script for Elizabeth Hansen's Module 2 for MSU's Data Analytics bootcamp. Included are the vba script as a Visual Basic Source file as well as the screenshots of their effect on the Multi_year_stock_data.xlsm data sheet. The vba script included runs through all sheets within a workbook and calculates the percent change for that year as well as the total stock volume for each ticker symbol. The script also formats the percent change to be red or green depending on whether it's positive or negative for that year. This could be done with simple conditional formatting rules but is more easily done with scripting so that each separate sheet of the workbook is formatted correctly.
Additionally, the script runs through the newly created table and outputs the company with the highest percent change, most negative percent change as well as which company had the highest stock volume for that year. Unfortunately it only does this for each sheet so in order to see the max of these categories for all three years you would have to manually compare each sheet's values.
